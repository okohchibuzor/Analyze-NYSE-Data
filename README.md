### TASK 1

For this task, I analyzed the revenue data for the six real estate sub industries. Over four years, these these industries generated a total revenue of $247.7 billion. The sub industry with the highest revenue was REITs, which had over $166 billion in revenue. 
For the second part of the task, I included a summary statistics showing the measures of central tendency (mean, median) and measures of spread (standard deviation and range).

### TASK 2

To solve this task, I created a Profit and Loss Statement dashboard that shows the key financial data, including revenue, gross profit, operating expenses and operating income before interest and taxes for the past four years.
The INDEX and MATCH functions were used to look up and retrieve the financial data from the project data worksheet.

I created a drop-down list using data validation which is connected to the profit and loss table. When a company is selected from the drop-down list, the income statement for that company is displayed in the table.
